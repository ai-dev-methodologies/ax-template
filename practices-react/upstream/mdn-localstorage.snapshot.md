# Snapshot: MDN — Window.localStorage

## Failure modes (verbatim)

> "May throw a SecurityError if storage is disabled or quota is exceeded."

> "When the storage origin is forbidden by the user agent (for example, when in private browsing mode in some browsers like Safari), calling setItem() or any other API method modifying storage will throw a SecurityError."

## Storage scope and lifetime

- Origin-scoped. `https://example.com:443` and `http://example.com:80` are separate origins.
- Persists across page reloads and browser restarts.
- Cleared by user (clear site data) or by storage pressure under certain conditions.

## Limits

- Typical quota: ~5 MB per origin (browser-dependent).
- Exceeding quota throws on `setItem`.

## SSR consideration

- `window` is undefined in Node.js / SSR contexts.
- `if (typeof window === 'undefined') return DEFAULT` is the standard guard.

## Audit implication

Any localStorage access without try-catch is a latent error in private-mode users and quota-pressed users. Any access without SSR guard breaks hydration on Next.js / SSR setups.

It’s been available across browsers since July 2015. Learn more See full compatibility The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document 's origin ; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. localStorage is similar to sessionStorage , except that while localStorage data has no expiration time, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when the page is closed. ( localStorage data for a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed.) In this article Value Description Examples Specifications Browser compatibility See also Value A Storage object which can be used to access the current origin's local storage space. Exceptions SecurityError Thrown in one of the following cases: The origin is not a valid scheme/host/port tuple . This can happen if the origin uses the file: or data: schemes, for example. The request violates a policy decision. For example, the user has configured the browsers to prevent the page from persisting data. Note that if the user blocks cookies, browsers will probably interpret this as an instruction to prevent the page from persisting data. Description The keys and the values stored with localStorage are in the UTF-16 string format. As with objects, integer keys are automatically converted to strings. localStorage data is specific to the protocol of the document . In particular, for a site loaded over HTTP (e.g., http://example.com ), localStorage returns a different object than localStorage for the corresponding site loaded over HTTPS (e.g., https://example.com ). For documents loaded from file: URLs (that is, files opened in the browser directly from the user's local filesystem, rather than being served from a web server) the requirements for localStorage behavior are undefined and may vary among different browsers. In all current browsers, localStorage seems to return a different object for each file: URL. In other words, each file: URL seems to have its own unique local-storage area. But there are no guarantees about that behavior, so you shouldn't rely on it because, as mentioned above, the requirements for file: URLs remain undefined. So it's possible that browsers may change their file: URL handling for localStorage at any time. In fact some browsers have changed their handling for it over time. Examples The following snippet accesses the current domain's local Storage object and adds a data item to it using Storage.setItem() , or updates the item if one already exists for that key. js localStorage.setItem("myCat", "Tom"); The syntax for reading the localStorage item is as follows: js const cat = localStorage.getItem("myCat"); The syntax for removing the localStorage item is as follows: js localStorage.removeItem("myCat"); The syntax for removing all the localStorage items is as follows: js localStorage.clear(); Note: Please refer to the Using the Web Storage API article for a full example.
